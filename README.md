ec2 info
--------
i didn't add the .pem, because i don't want randos logging in and breaking the
app. i'm sure they're out there, waiting, watching.

to login simply put the .pem that i emailed you into this directory and run
the login script. you may need to change the permissions on the .pem file to
600 .
